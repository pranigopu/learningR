#' way ANOVA with respect to all the aspects using a suitable dataset(s) and draw

#' DEFINITIONS
#------------------------
#' TWO FACTOR DESIGN
#
#' This is an experimental design i.e. a method using which data is collected and organised.
#' Two-factor design is a design wherein data is collected on two interacting treatments, and is collected
#' not only for every level of each treatment, but for every possible combination of treatment levels among the two treatments.
#' i.e. every possible interaction.
#------------------------
#' TWO-WAY ANOVA
#
#' This is a statistical test of significance, that estimates the significance
#' of the effect of two variables (separately, and if possible, with interaction)
#' on the response variable.
#' It involves a null hypothesis for each treatment separately and their interactions (if possible),
#' and states that the mean responses for ever level of the treatment or treatment interaction is equal.
#' To estimate significance, we use the F-statistic.
#' A significant result means the null hypothesis is rejected.
#========================
#' Two-factor design uses two-way ANOVA as a statistical test for significance of factors.
#' The only point to remember is that the interactions are always available and are exhaustive, when using this design.
