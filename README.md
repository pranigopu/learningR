# Statistical analysis using R
Learning R is a part of my undergraduate course, but I have attempted to be more thorough and comprehensive in the documentation of my learning and my assignments.

Note that all my data is in the "data" directory. Before every program, I set my working directory to this data directory in my computer. Remember to modify the path for your system, as needed.
