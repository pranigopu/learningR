# Statistical analysis using R
Statistical analysis using R is a part of my undergraduate course, but I have attempted to be more thorough and comprehensive in the documentation of my learning and my assignments. I have also worked on Python modules such as Scikit-learn, Plotly and Dash to do statistical analyses in a more presentable and interactive way in Python.

Note that all my data is in the "data" directory. Before every program, I set my working directory to this data directory in my computer. Remember to modify the path for your system, as needed.
