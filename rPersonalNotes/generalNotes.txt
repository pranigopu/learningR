1.
Data frame or matrix column selections
___
Say you have a matrix or data frame "dataFrame".
dataFrame[a:b] selects column from a to b (inclusive).
dataFrame[a] selects column a.
dataFrame[c(a, b, c)] selects columns a, b and c specifically.

before plotting.

4.
Printing in R
___
R provides the paste method to print output with string and variable together. This method defined inside the print function. The paste function converts its arguments to character strings. One can also use  the paste0 method.
___
It is used as follows
print(paste(arg1, arg2...))

The arguments for paste can be variables or strings in any order. They will be put into a string in the order you enter the arguments in. Each argument is automatically separated by a space.
___
NOTE:
The difference between paste and paste0 is that the argument sep by default is " " in paste and "" (null character) in paste0.

5.
Return value of user-defined functions
___
You need not use any keyword such as "return" to send back a value from the function's execution. The last expression becomes the return value.
___
For example...
f = function(x)
{
	x * x
}
myValue = f(2)
print(myValue)
--x--
Output:
4
