SYNTAX
___
aov(dependentVariable ~ independentVariable, dataSet)
dependentVariable => response variable
independentVariable => factor variable

An independent variable in this case would either be a treatment or variety set. I will refer to independent variables as such, not factors, to avoid confusion with factor data type.
---*---*---
PURPOSE
___
Fits an analysis of variance model to the given data by a call to lm for each stratum. Note that lm is a function that creates a linear regression between two variables.

I assume that in this case, for each call, the response variable's observed values are the values for a particular level of the independent variable. I also assume that the regressor in each case simply becomes a set of indices... [TO BE CONFIRMED]
___
The aov function performs ANOVA analysis for the different levels of the independent variable, with respect to the dependent variable. Then, returns the derived values, particularly
- F-value
- Probability of F-value exceeding table value
  --When estimated generally for any sample--

PROPER USAGE
___
NOTE:
--x--
factor / factor variable => independent variable
factor / factor data type => discrete non-numeric value

The are not synonymous. So, to avoid confusion, I will not refer to independent variables as factors or factor variables.
___
INDEPENDENT VARIABLE AS FACTOR TYPE
--x--
For the levels of the independent variable (i.e. treatment or variety) to be treated as levels, you must convert the values to factor values i.e. non-numeric.

This is vital, since aov calls lm, and if lm encounters the independent variables values as numeric, it will create a single linear regression model between the independent variable and the response. Making the independent variable values as factors makes each lm call make a separate linear regression model for each level i.e. each value of the independent variable i.e. each class.

Note that levels of a factor are, for all practical purposes, factors in ANOVA test, since each level represents a different class.
___
SUMMARY OF TEST VALUES
--x--
To see all the values of the model returned by this function, use the summary function on its return value, as in...

aovModel = aov(y ~ x, myData)
summary(aovModel)
___
ALTERNATIVE APPROACH
--x--
An alternate and equivalent way to perform ANOVA through aov, given factor x and response y, is as follows...
linearRegressionModel = lm(y ~ x)
aovModel = aov(linearRegressionModel)

Or to combine...
aovModel = aov(lm(y ~ x))
