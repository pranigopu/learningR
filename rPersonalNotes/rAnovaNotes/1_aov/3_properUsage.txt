NOTE:
___
factor / factor variable => independent variable
factor / factor data type => discrete non-numeric value

The are not synonymous. So, to avoid confusion, I will not refer to independent variables as factors or factor variables.

1.
INDEPENDENT VARIABLE AS FACTOR TYPE
___
For the levels of the independent variable (i.e. treatment or variety) to be treated as levels, you must convert the values to factor values i.e. non-numeric.

This is vital, since aov calls lm, and if lm encounters the independent variables values as numeric, it will create a single linear regression model between the independent variable and the response. Making the independent variable values as factors makes each lm call make a separate linear regression model for each level i.e. each value of the independent variable i.e. each class.

Note that levels of a factor are, for all practical purposes, factors in ANOVA test, since each level represents a different class.

SUMMARY OF TEST VALUES
___
To see all the values of the model returned by this function, use the summary function on its return value, as in...

aovModel = aov(y ~ x, myData)
summary(aovModel)
---*---*---

ALTERNATIVE APPROACH
___
An alternate and equivalent way to perform ANOVA through aov, given factor x and response y, is as follows...
linearRegressionModel = lm(y ~ x)
aovModel = aov(linearRegressionModel)

Or to combine...
aovModel = aov(lm(y ~ x))
