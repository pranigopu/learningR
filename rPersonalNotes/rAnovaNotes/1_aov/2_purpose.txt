PURPOSE OF AOV
---*---*---
Fits an analysis of variance model to the given data by a call to lm for each stratum. Note that lm is a function that creates a linear regression between two variables.

I assume that in this case, for each call, the response variable's observed values are the values for a particular level of the independent variable. I also assume that the regressor in each case simply becomes a set of indices... [TO BE CONFIRMED]
---*---*---
The aov function performs ANOVA analysis for the different levels of the independent variable, with respect to the dependent variable. Then, returns the derived values, particularly
- F-value
- Probability of F-value exceeding table value
  --When estimated generally for any sample--
