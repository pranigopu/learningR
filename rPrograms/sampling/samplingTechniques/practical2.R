#' QUESTION 1
#
#' Obtain an estimate of the average miles per gallon (mpg) of cars by taking a 
#' sample of size 8 using without replacement procedure.
#
#' Sample mean is an unbiased estimator of population mean.
#' Here, the population is all the cars in the data set,
#' and the sample is 8 random cars chosen from the data set.
#' The estimate of the population's mpg will be the sample's mpg.

# The population
population = mtcars$mpg

# To ensure we get the same random sample...
set.seed(13)
sampleSize = 8

# Creating the sample
sample = sample(population, sampleSize, replace = FALSE)
sample

# Calculating the estimated mean mpg
est_mean_mpg = mean(sample)
est_mean_mpg
#
#' QUESTION 2
#
#' Check that whether the above sample using WOR provides an unbiased estimate 
#' of the population mean.
#' Note that bias is the sampling error i.e. the difference between the estimate
#' the population parameter.
# Calculating sampling error i.e. bias
mean(population) - est_mean_mpg

# Calculating the percentage of the actual parameter the estimate reaches
(est_mean_mpg/mean(population)) * 100
#' As we can see, the bias is not 0, and is not close to 0. So, our estimate is not
#' unbiased. However, since sample mean is an unbiased estimator in general,
#' we can conclude that the large bias is due a small and heterogenous population,
#' where getting representative samples is difficult. Also, our sample is small,
#' so there is more chance that the sample is not representative.
#
#' QUESTION 3
#
#' Compute the sample mean square of mpg using above sample.
#' The formula for sample mean square is (1 / (n - 1)) * âˆ‘(y_i - y_bar)^2, where
#' y_i is the ith sample element and y_bar is the sample mean.
#
# Defining n and y_bar (although y_bar = est_mean_mpg, we do this to avoid confusion)
n = sampleSize
y_bar =  mean(sample)

# Finding the sum of square deviations
sum = 0
for(i in 1:8)
{
  deviation = sample[i] - y_bar
  sum = sum + deviation**2
}

# The sum of square deviations
sum

# Applying values to the formula
sampleMeanSquare = (1 / (n - 1)) * sum
sampleMeanSquare

# Comparing the above value to the value derived from an inbuilt function
var(sample)

#' Now we know that the inbuilt function follows the same formula.
#' Anyways, the sample mean square of the sample is around 14.58696.
#' So, the elements of the sample differ on average by around 14.58696 units.

#
#' QUESTION 4
#
#' Obtain standard error of an estimate of the sample taken above.
#
# NOTE: Sampling is done without replacement.
#' The estimate i.e. the statistic we choose to find the standard error of is simply
#' the sample mean i.e. y_bar i.e. est_mean_mpg
#
#' SE(y_bar) = sqrt(V(y_bar)), where SE(y_bar) is the standard error and 
#' V(y_bar) is the variance, both for y_bar.
#
#' V(y_bar) = ((N - n) / N) * s^2 / n, where N is the population size,
#' n is the sample size, and s^2 is the sample mean square.
#
# Sample mean square has been calculated above, so we leave it as it is.
# Population and sample sizes
N = length(population)
n = length(sample)

# Variance of sample mean y_bar
variance = ((N - n) / N) * sampleMeanSquare**2

# Standard error of sample mean y_bar
se = sqrt(variance)
se
#' Hence, we may conclude that on average, the sample means taken from different samples
#' of 8 from the given population will deviate by around 12.63268 units from
#' their mean i.e. the mean of sample means i.e. the expected value of the sample means.
#
#' QUESTION 5
#
#' Obtain an unbiased estimate of population total Y i.e. N * y_bar.
#
#' As given in the question, it is true that N * y_bar is an unbiased estimator
#' of the population total, where N is the population size and y_bar is the
#' sample mean (this is a corollary of the fact that sample mean is an
#' unbiased estimator of population mean).
# Obtaining N and y_bar
N = length(population)
y_bar = mean(sample)

# Obtaining the estimate of population total
est_popl_total = N * y_bar
est_popl_total

#' Extra...
# Comparing it actual population total
sum(population)

#' So, according to our estimate alone, the total mpg of all the cars in the
#' data set is 541.2. This is far from the actual sum 642.9, but that could be explained
#' by the difficulty of drawing a representative sample from such a small and
#' heterogenous population.
