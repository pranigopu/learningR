#' QUESTION 1
#------------
#' AIM
#______
#' Generate an ARMA(1,2) process of size 1000.
#' Is the process stationary? Comment on its ACF and PACF plots.
#------------
z = arima.sim(model = list(ar = c(0.3), ma = c(0.6, 0.7)), 1000)
#' By design, an ARMA model is a stationary time series model i.e. it is
#' a stationary time series process used as a model for actual data.
#' Hence, data based on this model will likely be stationary as well.
#' To confirm, we perform the augmented Dickey-Fuller test. We can also
#' judge the stationarity based on the ACF and PACF plots.
#------------
#' Augmented Dickey-Fuller test
library(tseries)
adf.test(z)
#' As we can see, p-value â‰¤ 0.01, which indicates that, given a 0.05
#' level of significance, we may reject the null hypothesis that the data
#' is not stationary. Hence, we may accept the alternative hypothesis
#' that the data is stationary, confirming our original statements.
#------------
#' ACF and PACF plots
acf(z,
    main = "ACF plot")
#' From the above plot, we find that past observations are positively
#' significantly correlated to the current observation upto lag 10
#' (excluding lags 5 and 6). However, the ACF seems to be some damped
#' oscillatory function of the lag, suggesting weak stationarity.
pacf(z,
     main = "PACF plot")
#' From the above plot, we find that past observations are
#' significantly correlated to the current observation upto lag 7,
#' when we keep the effect of the in-between lags constant. The signs
#' of the autocorrelation coefficients are not the same for every lag,
#' showing some dampened oscillatory movement.

#' QUESTION 2
#------------
#' AIM
#______
#' Choose two-time series data sets with non-stationary components
#' and demonstrate the method of moving average, method of
#' differencing, and the method of seasonal differencing to extract
#' the stationary components.
#______
data = read.csv("~/Documents/Study/computerScience/programming/r/data/agriculturalRawMaterial.csv")
data = data[c(1, 2, 4)]
head(data)
summary(data)
z1 = data$Coarse.wool.Price
z2 = data$Copra.Price
months = data$Month
#------------
#' Defining and formatting the 'Month' variable
#' (for better date summary)
#______
t = c()
for(x in months)
{
  x = paste("01", x, sep = "-")
  t = c(t, x)
}
t = as.Date(t, format = "%d-%b-%y")
# %b => abbreviated month
# %y => 2 digit year
# It can recognize century on its own.
# So for example, '93' will be interpreted as '1993'.
#______
#' Summarising dates
summary(t)
#------------
#' Converting to time series
#______
Z1 = ts(z1, start = c(1990, 4, 1), end = c(2020, 6, 1), frequency = 12)
Z2 = ts(z2, start = c(1990, 4, 1), end = c(2020, 6, 1), frequency = 12)
# frequency = 12 -> monthly frequency
#------------
#' Time plots before smoothing or differencing
#______
ts.plot(Z1,
        main = "Coarse wool prices",
        ylab = "Price")
ts.plot(Z2,
        main = "Copra prices",
        ylab = "Price")
#------------
#' Moving average smoothing
#______
#' This is a method of estimating trend at particular time points
#' using the moving average of a fixed number of observations
#' around the particular time points.

mas = function(ts, order)
{
  ma = c()
  # If order is n, that means n = 2d + 1, where
  # [t-d, t+d] is the interval of time points for which
  # average is taken.
  d = (order - 1)/2
  for(i in c(d+1:length(ts)-d-1))
  {
    sum = 0
    for(j in c(-d:d))
    {
      sum = sum + ts[i+j]
    }
    ma = c(ma, sum/order)
  }
  return(ma)
}

#' The order of smoothing must be chosen based on requirement, which
#' often depends on the level of periodic and irregular fluctuations
#' in the data. In the given data, there is a high degree of
#' irregular fluctuations, and hence, I will choose a higher order.
plot(mas(Z1, 11),
     type = 'l',
     main = 'Smoothed course wool prices',
     ylab = 'Price')

plot(mas(Z2, 11),
     type = 'l',
     main = 'Smoothed copra prices',
     ylab = 'Price')

#' From the above, we can see that both datasets display no clear
#' trend.
#------------
#' Method of differencing
#______
#' 1st order differencing: z_t-bar = z_t - z_(t-1)
Z1_notrend = diff(Z1)

        main = "Copra prices (no trend)",
        ylab = "Price")
#______
#' Seasonal differencing
#...
#' Our data is monthly, so one seasonal period is 12. Hence, we do
#' differencing at a lag of 12.
Z1_noseasonality = diff(Z1, 12)

ts.plot(Z2_noseasonality,
