#' OBJECTIVE
#
#' The yield in quintals for paddy crop of 50 villages in a certain area are given in the excel sheet.
#' Select a simple random sample of size 10 units using without replacement procedure and estimate the average yield per plot
#' along with the five number summary statistics of the population.
#' Interpret your results.
#
#' DATA DESCRIPTION

#' Certain data descriptors
summary(myData)
#' The data contains 50 entries, with one field that is the yield of paddy crops measured in quintals.
#' The lowest yield measured is 10 quintals, and the highest measured is 75 quintals.
#' The mean yield in this data set is 31.82 quintals.

#' ANALYSIS
#
#' Question summary
# Population size: 50
# Required sample size: 10
# Estimates required: All the parameters in listed in the smmary function i.e.
#   - Minimum
#   - Maximum
#   - 1st quartile
#   - Median
#   - 3rd quartile
#   - Mean
# NOTE: Sampling must be done without replacement
sampleSize = 10
set.seed(132)
# Setting the seed fixes the random sample generation, so the sample is random but predictable
population = myData$yield
