Switch-case in R
---*---*---
In general, switch -case statements are a substitute for long if-else statements that compare a variable to several integral values. They allow a variable to be tested for equality against a list of values.

In R, switch-case is a function with the following properties...
- An expression type with character string always matched to the listed cases.
- An expression which is not a character string then this exp is coerced to integer.
- For multiple matches, the first match element will be used.
- No default argument case is available there in R switch case.
- An unnamed case can be used, if there is no matched case.

It has the following arguments...
switch(expression, case1, case2, case3...)
--x--
Each case is an equality, such as
"a" = 3
For this case, if the expression is matched with "a", the switch function returns 3. Here is a fuller example...
--x--
c = "x"
p = switch(c, "x" = 1, "y" = 2, "z" = 3)
print(p)
......
Output:
1
