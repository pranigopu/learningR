Tukey test
---*---*---
DESCRIPTION
___
Tukey test allows to find pairs of factor levels whose means are significantly different from each other, comparing all possible pairs of means with a t-test like method.

Tukey test is a single-step multiple comparison procedure and statistical test. It is a post-hoc analysis method, what means that it is used in conjunction with an ANOVA.

INSTALLATION
___
In R, the multcompView package allows to run the Tukey test thanks to the TukeyHSD() function. If this package is not installed in your machine, use the function
install.packages(multcompView)
---*---*---
USAGE
___
TukeyHSD(x = aovModel, conf.level = 0.95)

aovModel is the ANOVA model, which can also be the return value of the aov function.
conf.level refers to the confidence interval.

Note that the independent variable's values, or levels in this case, must be in factor type i.e. non-numeric. You must have changed or kept the factor levels (or the x-values) to factor type using the as.factor method before the ANOVA test itself.

INTERPRETATION
___
For our purposes, we will only focus on the left-most and right-most columns i.e. the pair of factor levels and the adjusted p-value for that pair of factor levels. As usual, compare the adjusted p-value to the significance level. If the p-value is greater, then the difference between the means of that pair of levels is insignificant, or else if the p-value is lesser, the difference is significant.
___
EXTRA NOTE ON ADJUSTED P-VALUE
--x--
The adjusted p (p adj) value is the smallest significance level at which a particular comparison will be declared statistically significant as part of the multiple comparison testing. For example, say for the 1st pair 2-1 (where the levels are 1 and 2), p adj = 0.7, meaning if the difference between the means of 2 and 1 is to be considered statistically significant, then you must choose a significance level of at least 0.7.

However, if our chosen significance level is 0.05 or 5%, it is way below the required minimum in this case. Hence, with 0.05 or 5% significance, the difference is not considered statistically significant i.e. the difference is within the range from which the values (differences between means here) are expected to occur 95% of the time (confidence interval is 95%, hence the range of ‘non-outlier’ values, as determined by us, covers 95% of the most probably occurring values).

EXTRA NOTES DEALING WITH TUKEY HSD OBJECT
___
To access a particular column, from the TukeyHSD object t, say the adjusted p-value or 'p adj' (which is column 4 in the object), we may do one of the following
--x--
t$x[,'p adj']
t$x[,4]
--x--
t$x[,] accesses all the columns of the object.
___
CONVERTING TO DATAFRAME FOR EASEOF HANDLING...
--x--
t = TukeyHSD(x = aovModel, conf.level = 0.95)
t = as.data.frame(t$x[,])
--x--
Of course, we may turn one or more columns alone into dataframes too.
