SYNTAX
---*---*---
aov(dependentVariable ~ independentVariable, dataSet)
dependentVariable => response variable
independentVariable => factor variable

An independent variable in this case would either be a treatment or variety set. I will refer to independent variables as such, not factors, to avoid confusion with factor data type.
