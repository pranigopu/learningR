ASSUMPTIONS FOR PAIRED T-TEST

We use paired t-test, which assumes the following:
1. Samples are taken from normal distributions
   (This is checked using Shapiro-Wilk test)
2. Each sample's each observation is independently drawn
3. Sample values are taken from populations with the same variances
   (This is checked using F-test)
4. There are no outliers
   (This is checked using boxplot)
